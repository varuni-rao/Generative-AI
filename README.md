# Generative AI Projects
This folder is a collection of all Generative AI projects that I work on.

## Project list: 
#### 1) [Conversation-Sentiment](https://speech-sentiment-analyzer.ue.r.appspot.com):
This is my first Generative AI project done as a part of a interview process for a budding startup. While the position did not workout for me, the entire journey of learning a new technology - Gen AI - create new content was very exciting. This is also the first project that I have hosted on a Cloud. I used Google Cloud Services (GCS) App Engine to host this app. GCS App Engine works well for apps that are light and are not likely to be used that often.

Note to a potential employer: This site is not live right now. I will pay and make it online when a potential job opportunity is available to me.
